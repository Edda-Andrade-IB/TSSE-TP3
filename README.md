# Introduction

This repository will be used for the final practical work of "Microprocessor
Programming" (PdM from now on, due to its acronym in Spanish).

It will be used for the development of various practical tasks assigned in the
subject, likewise it will be used to house the code made for the final project
of the subject.

# SetUp

The subject mandatory requires the use of the Stm32Cube IDE, so all projects
will be eclipse projects for said IDE.

To use the code stored in this repository you must first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicolasIriarte/LCD1602_I2C LCD1602_I2C_NicolasIriarte
```

And from your IDE import this project.

**NOTE**: All the code provided will be made for the NUCLEO-F429zi microcontroller.
